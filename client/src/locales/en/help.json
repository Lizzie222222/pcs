INVESTIGATE (3-6 weeks) - Conducting the waste audit and analyzing results. ACT (Ongoing) - Implementing your action plan is a continuous journey. Most schools complete all three stages within one academic term (12-16 weeks)."

        "after_completion": {
          "question": "What happens after we complete all three stages?",

Many schools also progress to more advanced sustainability projects."

        },

          "answer": "Track impact through the dashboard's tracking tools: Log baseline measurements from your audit, record weekly or monthly progress updates, upload photos of implemented changes, input quantitative data (items reduced, weight of plastic saved), and document student participation numbers. The system generates charts and reports showing your progress over time."
        },
        "student_involvement": {
          "question": "How should students be involved in the action plan?",
