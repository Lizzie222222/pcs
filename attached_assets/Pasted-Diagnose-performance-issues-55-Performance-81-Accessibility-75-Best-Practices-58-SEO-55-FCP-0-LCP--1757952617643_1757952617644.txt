Accessibility
These checks highlight opportunities to improve the accessibility of your web app. Automatic detection can only detect a subset of issues and does not guarantee the accessibility of your web app, so manual testing is also encouraged.
Names and labels
Buttons do not have an accessible name
<frame> or <iframe> elements do not have a title
These are opportunities to improve the semantics of the controls in your application. This may enhance the experience for users of assistive technology, like a screen reader.
Best practices
[user-scalable="no"] is used in the <meta name="viewport"> element or the [maximum-scale] attribute is less than 5.
These items highlight common accessibility best practices.
Contrast
Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.
These are opportunities to improve the legibility of your content.
Navigation
Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order
These are opportunities to improve keyboard navigation in your application.
Audio and video
<video> elements contain a <track> element with [kind="captions"]
These are opportunities to provide alternative content for audio and video. This may improve the experience for users with hearing or vision impairments.
