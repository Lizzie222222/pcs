1. Media Library

Add a Media Library section to the Admin Panel.

It must store all images and evidence submitted by schools.

Include filter options:

Private (only visible internally)

Public (shared or published assets)

Each item should display metadata (school name, upload date, file type, visibility status).

2. “Promises” → “Action Plan”

Replace all mentions of “Promises” with “Action Plan.”

This feature should be triggered from the Investigate stage under Action Plan.

When users complete an Action Plan, the same pop-up/modal should appear as the old “Promises” flow.

Ensure backward compatibility with existing data if “Promises” entries exist.

3. Repeat Course Completion Logic

Users can complete the course multiple times.

On each full completion:

Send a “celebration email” to the participant.

Allow them to restart the course.

Label course iterations as:
Inspire II, Investigate II, Act II, Inspire III, etc.

In the Admin Panel:

Add filter and sorting by completion count or course iteration.

Display iteration labels in user progress data.

4. School Preferred Language

Each school must have a preferred language field.

This should be visible and editable in the Admin Panel.

5. Bulk Email Filters by Language

In the Bulk Email section, allow admins to filter recipients by preferred language before sending.

6. Auto-Translation in Bulk Emails

Explore adding auto-translate for bulk email content.

UX suggestion:

When composing an email, show a toggle or dropdown for “Translate email into [language]”.

Allow preview/edit before sending.

Aim for clarity and control—avoid auto-sending unreviewed translations.

7. Email Template Editor Enhancements

Currently, admins can edit:

Title

Preheader

Header

Subject

Body text

Extend this to support emails containing images.

For one-off newsletters:

Consider a simple drag-and-drop or rich text editor in the admin dashboard.

Evaluate trade-off: flexibility vs. complexity/time cost.

(If too time-consuming, add ability to upload HTML/email templates directly.)

8. Printable Audit & Action Plan Submission

Schools should be able to print the Audit and Action Plan.

After completing them offline (on paper), they should be able to upload photos or PDFs as submission evidence.

In the Admin Panel:

Add the printable files (already exist) as resources under each relevant step.

Allow schools to submit these uploads as valid completions without taking the quiz.
