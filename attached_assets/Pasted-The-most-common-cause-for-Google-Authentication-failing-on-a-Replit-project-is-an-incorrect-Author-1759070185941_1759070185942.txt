The most common cause for Google Authentication failing on a Replit project is an incorrect **Authorized Redirect URI** in your **Google Cloud Console** settings.

Since your Replit project is hosted on a dynamic server environment, you must ensure that your Google OAuth settings are configured to redirect back to the correct, publicly accessible URL of your running Repl.

Here are the specific instructions for setting up the Google authentication credentials correctly:

## 1. Get Your Replit URL

You need to know the correct URL for your running Repl.

* When your Repl is running (click the **Run** button), look at the URL in the web view (browser pane) inside Replit.
* The format will typically be:
    * `https://[Repl-Name].[Username].repl.co` (for older Repls)
    * `https://[Deployment-Name].[Username].replit.app` (for newer deployments)
* **Copy the base URL of your application.** For example: `https://my-project-auth.myusername.replit.app`

## 2. Configure the Google Cloud Console

Go to the **Google Cloud Console** where you created your OAuth 2.0 Client ID. This is typically under **APIs & Services** $\rightarrow$ **Credentials**.

### Authorized JavaScript Origins

* In the **Authorized JavaScript origins** field, enter your base Replit URL:
    * Example: `https://my-project-auth.myusername.replit.app`

### Authorized Redirect URIs (Crucial Step)

* This is where Google sends the user back after they've successfully signed in.
* You must provide the **full callback URL** that your application is configured to handle. If your code handles the callback at the path `/callback` (which is common), the URI should be:
    * **Full URL:** `https://[Your-Repl-URL]/callback`
    * Example: `https://my-project-auth.myusername.replit.app/callback`

⚠️ **Important Notes on Replit URLs:**

* **Make sure you use `https://`** as Google requires secure connections for OAuth flows.
* The exact structure of the Replit URL can change, especially if you are using a **Deployment** versus a standard running Repl. Always verify the actual live URL your code will run on. If your app is deployed, use the deployment URL.
* Some users have reported issues where Replit's infrastructure uses a temporary workspace URL (e.g., `https://workspace.xyz.replit.app`) during the OAuth redirect. If your primary URL is failing, and you see a different URL in your browser error, you may need to **temporarily add that problematic workspace URL** to your list of Authorized Redirect URIs for debugging, though the official Replit URL is usually the correct one to use.

## 3. Check Other Settings

* **Client ID and Secret:** Ensure the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in your Replit project's code or **Secrets** panel exactly match the credentials generated in the Google Cloud Console.
* **Environment Variables:** If you're using a web framework like Flask/Express and a library like `oauthlib`, you might need to set the environment variable **`OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT`** to `'1'` in your Replit **Secrets** tab, especially if you are running the Repl in a non-deployed state that might be treated as HTTP by the library (though Replit's web view is typically HTTPS).
* **Protocol Mismatch:** Ensure your application's code is correctly generating the redirect URL with `https://`. A common issue is the app generating an `http://` URL when it needs to be `https://`.
