🧭 Plastic Clever Schools Waste Audit

Welcome to the Plastic Clever Schools Audit!
This audit helps you understand what types and amounts of single-use plastics are being used at your school.
By identifying these “problem plastics” — where they come from and how many are used — you’ll be able to make a plan to tackle them.

🌟 How It Works

There are 4 Parts to the audit, plus a Results section at the end.
Each part focuses on a different area of your school.

Part 1: About Your School

Part 2: Lunchroom & Staffroom

Part 3: Classrooms & Bathrooms

Part 4: Waste Management

Results Tab: Calculates your total and highlights your top problem plastics.

You can do this audit as a class project or eco-team challenge.
Ask teachers or staff (like caretakers, kitchen staff, or administrators) for help where needed.

🟡 PART 1 — About Your School
